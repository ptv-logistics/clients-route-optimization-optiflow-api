     * A constant string that can be used to identify this warning class programmatically.
     * 
     * If additional information is available for a warningCode, it will be provided as key-value pairs with the parameter **details**. The keys available for a specific warningCode are documented directly with the warningCode. Unless stated otherwise, the values are of type string.
     * 
     * As an example, the following warningCode provides four key-value pairs in the **details**. The keys are called **parameter**, **value**, **relatedParameter** and **relatedValue**.
     * * `GENERAL_PARAMETER_IGNORED` - A parameter was ignored.
     *   * `parameter` - The ignored parameter.
     *   * `value` - The value of the ignored parameter.
     *   * `relatedParameter` - The parameter which caused the parameter in question to be ignored.
     *   * `relatedValue` - The value which caused the parameter in question to be ignored. Not present if the conflict is independent of the value.
     * 
     * Note that additional warningCode as well as the **details** of existing warningCode may be added at any time. Furthermore, the **description** may change at any time.
     * * `ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION_VEHICLE_EMPTY_ROUTE_VIOLATED` - A vehicle is excluded from optimization because it cannot drive from start to end without violating constraints.
     *   * `vehicleId` - The unique identifier of the vehicle.
     * * `ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION_NO_VEHICLE_FOR_ORDER` - An order is excluded from optimization because it cannot be scheduled on any route of the provided vehicles.
     *   * `orderId` - The unique identifier of the order.
     *   * `reasons` - The reason(s) why this order could not be scheduled on any route of the provided vehicles (object).
     * * `ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION_NO_ORDER_FOR_VEHICLE` - A vehicle is excluded from optimization because no order can be scheduled on the route of the vehicle.
     *   * `vehicleId` - The unique identifier of the vehicle.
     *   * `reasons` - The reason(s) why no orders could be scheduled on the route of this vehicle (object).
     * * `ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION_NO_DEPOTS_FOR_VEHICLE` - A vehicle is excluded from optimization because no depot can be scheduled on the route of the vehicle.
     *   * `vehicleId` - The unique identifier of the vehicle.
     * * `ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION_LOCATION_UNREACHABLE` - Travel times and distances cannot be calculated to or from the provided location.
     *   * `locationId` - The unique identifier of the location.
     * * `ROUTE_OPTIMIZATION_TRAFFIC_DATA_MISSING` - Traffic data is missing for routes to and from some locations. Optimistic travel times will be used instead.
     *   * `locationIds` - The unique identifiers of the locations to and from which traffic data is missing (array).
     *   * `profile` - The vehicle routing profile for which traffic data is missing.
     *   * `trafficMode` - The vehicle traffic mode for which traffic data is missing.
