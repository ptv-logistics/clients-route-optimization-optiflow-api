/**
 * Specifies an increased cost per effort if the route's repositioning effort goes above a threshold.
 * When two orders are loaded into the same compartment and delivered in the reverse order, we refer to them as a non-last-in-first-out (non-LIFO) pair. Any non-LIFO pair of orders requires repositioning in the vehicle, as the last picked-up order obstructs the first order that needs to be delivered. The effort involved in this repositioning is the minimum effort required for the two orders. The total repositioning effort for the route is the sum of the repositioning efforts for all non-LIFO pairs of orders.
