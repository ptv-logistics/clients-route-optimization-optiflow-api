 * A list of orders that should be scheduled by the optimization on the routes. When providing pickup-delivery orders, it is not possible to provide other order types. If pickup orders or delivery orders are provided, at least one depot must be provided where the pickup orders can be delivered to or the delivery orders can be picked up from. The unique identifiers of the orders must by unique across the three types.
 * Orders of the same type always satisfy the "last in, first out" (LIFO) principle,with respect to each other. When an order is picked up while another order of the same type is already loaded, the former should be delivered before the latter. Orders of different types do not have to satisfy the LIFO principle. For example, if a pickup order is picked up while a delivery order is loaded, the delivery order can be delivered before the pickup order is delivered at depot.
