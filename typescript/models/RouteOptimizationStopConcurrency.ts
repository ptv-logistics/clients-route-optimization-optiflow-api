 * If stop concurrency is specified, each stop at the location must be assigned to a vehicle slot. Two stops may be assigned to the same vehicle slot if the duration between the end of the last appointment of the first stop and the start of the first appointment of the other stop is at least the specified minimum buffer duration, in which case they are not considered concurrent stops. Assigning at least one stop to a slot incurs a cost, encouraging reduction of the maximum number of concurrent stops at the location. If there is no minimum buffer duration, stops where the first appointment starts at the same time as the last ends do not need to be assigned to a vehicle slot. When omitted, stops at this location will not be assigned to a vehicle slot.
