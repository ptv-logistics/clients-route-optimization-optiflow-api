/**
 * Describes the current status of the optimization.
 * * `QUEUING` - The optimization has been accepted. In order to start it has to wait for other optimizations to finish. The maximum number of concurrent optimizations is based on your individual price plan or contract. Optimizations that remain in the queue for more than 48 hours are aborted.
 * * `PREPARING` - The optimization has been accepted. Time-distance data is being calculated and the data is being prepared for optimization.
 * * `RUNNING` - The routes are being optimized. Metrics will provide insights into the current result of the optimization.
 * * `STOPPING` - A request has been received to stop the optimization. The optimization will stop as soon as possible.
 * * `FAILED` - The optimization has failed. An error will be provided to clarify what went wrong.
 * * `SUCCEEDED` - The optimization has completed successfully.
